# TrackBallScroll
Autohotkey script to enable vertical scrolling with a Logitech Trackman (and probably any other) by holding the right mouse button.

# Install
 1. Install [autohotkey](https://autohotkey.com/)
 2. Put TrackBallScroll.ahk somewhere on your PC.
 3. Press "windows+r" keys, type in "shell:startup" and press enter.
 4. Put a shortcut to TrackBallScroll.ahk in the folder that opened to have it start at boot.

I removed the horizontal scrolling, adjusted the speed and tweaked the behavior to have it a bit smoother.
